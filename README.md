# Take Every Card
 Have you ever played Slay the Spire and wanted to take all three cards because you liked them all?

 Well, with this mod, now you can!

 ### **In fact, you *will.***

 This mod causes your character to automatically take every card in card rewards from combat, relics like Orrery, etc.
 Some card rewards are not affected, mostly Neow "choose a card" rewards and Draft mod, but there may be more I missed.
